  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The</b> Center for Advanced Energy Studies (CAES) is a research and education consortium among <a href = "https://inl.gov/">Idaho National Laboratory</a>, <a href = "https://www.boisestate.edu/">Boise State University</a>, <a href = "https://www.isu.edu">Idaho State University</a>, the <a href = "https://www.uidaho.edu/">University of Idaho</a>, and the <a href = "http://www.uwyo.edu/">University of Wyoming</a>.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src = "images\tech_1.jpg" id = "tech_1" align = "right"><b>The</b> center is committed to conducting cutting-edge energy research, educating the next generation of scientists and engineers, and partnering with industry to advance competitiveness.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>CAES’</b> research is focused on nuclear science and engineering, advanced materials science, energy systems design, testing and analysis, bioenergy, carbon management/geofluids energy science, industrial control cybersecurity, and energy policy.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>CAES</b> is about the power of partnership – solving technical challenges as a team. Several CAES institutions working together can provide value in a way an individual CAES institution working alone cannot. The CAES collaboration expands the competitiveness and impact of member research and enhances energy-related educational opportunities. CAES research and development involves the collaboration of at least two of its partners.</p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr. Noël Bakhtian</b> leads CAES. There are also associate directors from each of the university partners. The 55,000-square-foot building is owned by the state of Idaho, and <abbr title= "Idaho National Laboratory">INL</abbr> leases 68 percent of the building. The four universities lease 8 percent of the building.
