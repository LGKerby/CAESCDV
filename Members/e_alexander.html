  <p>With a computing and mathematics degree in Visualization from the University of Teesside and an Executive MBA from the University of Hull (both UK), Emma-Jane takes great pleasure in utilizing both technical and management skills to explore and nurture the successful adoption of technology and software in visualization centers. Currently the manager of the Shell 3D Visualization Center based within the School of Energy Resources, Emma-Jane enjoys the challenge of bringing together 3D visualization technical experts with teaching/research faculty and students to enhance teaching and learning. Emma-Jane is eager to seek out and develop new multi-disciplinary collaborative relationships with faculty at UW to leverage research opportunities. Alongside nurturing usage of the Shell 3D Viz Center for UW and businesses, Emma-Jane has particular interest in considering how schools can have access to the technology to widen their awareness by staff and pupils of opportunities in STEM. Emma-Jane has focused research interests in the application of therapeutic virtual reality treatment of obesity.</p>
