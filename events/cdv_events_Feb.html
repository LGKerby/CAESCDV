    ANNOUNCING KEYNOTE SPEAKER Dr. Ilkay Altintas. Dr. Altintas is the Chief Data Science Officer at the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC), UC San Diego, and Founder and Director for the Workflows for Data Science Center of Excellence and a Fellow of the Halicioglu Data Science Institute (HDSI). In her various roles and projects, she leads collaborative multi-disciplinary teams to deliver impactful research results by making computational data science reusable, programmable, scalable and reproducible. Since joining SDSC in 2001, she has been a principal investigator and a technical leader in a wide range of cross-disciplinary projects. Her work has been applied to many scientific and societal domains including bioinformatics, geoinformatics, high-energy physics, multi-scale biomedical science, smart cities, and smart manufacturing.</br></br>
    Dr. Altintas is also the founder and director of the WIFIRE Lab. The WIFIRE Lab develops integrated systems for natural hazards monitoring, simulation, and response. WIFIRE's mission is to conduct research and development on infrastructure, services and tools for artificial intelligence enabled fire science.</br></br>
    Read more about Dr. Altintas' Research Computing Days talk "Fighting Fires and Decision Support using Data and Cyber Systems."</br></br>
    Research Computing Days is FREE for the academic and research community and anyone (GAs to established researchers and professionals) looking to learn more and exchange ideas about scientific computing/programming, computational skills, and data science approaches. </br></br>
    If you know of students -- graduate, undergraduate, community college, career tech, high school -- who are interested in these areas, this is a great opportunity to introduce them to conferences, especially because it's FREE. Please feel free to forward this to anyone who might be interested -- undergraduates, graduate students, faculty, staff, professionals, colleagues etc. Many thanks!</br></br>
